## Scientia CLI

### Features and TODOs
A command line interface for the Imperial scientia website
- [X] Logging in and storing credentials using keychain (so you have to enter them once)
- [X] Fetching latest materials from scientia 
- [X] Concurrent download
- [ ] Making the CLI a lot cooler
- [ ] Setting up a daily fetch to get latest resources automatically
- [ ] Adding support for timetable assignments (depends on when scientia completes that feature:*)
- [ ] Gitlab, panopto support?
